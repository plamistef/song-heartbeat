# Visualize a data in a graph

This is a data logger project that utilizes the KY038 arduino sound and water sensors. The collected data is used to present a real-time graph by using the matplotlib python library.
The project was developed as a mandatory exercise for my C programming elective.

FOR RUNNING THE PROJECT:

You should use the Heartbeat.py and the file from the sound_water_sensor folder! The other files are for showing other solutions I have tried.
